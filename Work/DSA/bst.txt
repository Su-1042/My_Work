//deeleting a node

1. we will find the given node first
    search(tree root, int key)
    {
        if (key==root->val)
            return root;
        
        if (key<root->val)
            search(root->left,key);

        if (key>root->val)
            search(root->right,key);
    }

2. DELETING A LEAF NODE:if node has both left and right pointers as null then it is a leaf node
    
3.
    case1:-
        node has only left subtree 
        then the left subtree ka pointer is returned to the parent of the node being deleted

    case2:- 
        node has only right subtree
